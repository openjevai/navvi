 * `buildWriter` and in `createChooser`'s switch, plus one constructor. Its

 *
 *   - an OpenAI-compatible **base URL** (`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`), and
 *   - a **model id** (`qwen3:8b`).
 *
 * As a writer it is an `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` provider behind
 * `ModelChooser` (same JSON-schema-of-indices prompt, `costUsd` 0, billing
 * neither `api` nor `subscription`). As a decider it needs the local model to
 * answer the same structured shape: either an evaluation model like
 * `TypeSafeEvaluationModel` in `jev.ts` pointed at the local URL, or the
 * `ModelChooser` path, in which case `deciderTransport: "local"` is the third
 * transport and `LIMITS.chooserInputTokens` is the only budget that still
 * applies. Nothing accepts a `local` value yet — deliberately, so no input can
 * select a backend that would throw at run time.
